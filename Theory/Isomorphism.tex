\section*{Isomorphism}

An isomorphism is an invertible linear transformation $T$ such that $TT^{-1}=T^{-1}T=\Imat$. Therefore, the matrix of $T$ must be square invertible, so the dimensions of the domain and codomain must be equal.

\section*{Fundamental Subspaces of a Matrix}

The four fundamental subspaces of a matrix $A$ give us important information about the columns and rows of the matrix:

\subsubsection*{Row Space, Null Space or Kernel of $A$}

The Subspace $KerA$, $NulA$, or $RowA$ contains all the vectors $x$ such that $Ax=0$. Therefore, it contains all the solutions $x$ of the homogeneous system. The basis can be found by solving this system and expressing the solution in vector form. Then, the basis of $KerA$ is formed by the vectors that are multiplied by the free variables. Any combination of those vectors will be a solution to the homogeneous system.

\subsubsection*{Column Space or Range of $A$}

The Subspace $RanA$ or $ColA$ contains the basis for the columns of $A$. Therefore, any column of $A$ can be written as a linear combination of the vectors of the basis of $RanA$.

\subsubsection*{Row Space, Null Space or Kernel of $A^T$}

The Subspace $KerA^T$, $NulA^T$, or $RowA^T$ contains all the vectors $x$ such that $A^Tx=0$. Therefore, it contains all the solutions $x$ of the homogeneous system. The basis can be found by solving this system and expressing the solution in vector form. Then, the basis of $KerA^T$ is formed by the vectors that are multiplied by the free variables. Any combination of those vectors will be a solution to the homogeneous system.

\subsubsection*{Column Space or Range of $A^T$}

The Subspace $RanA^T$ or $ColA^T$ contains the basis for the columns of $A^T$, which are the the rows of $A$. Therefore, any row of $A$ can be written as a linear combination of the vectors of the basis of $RanA^T$.
