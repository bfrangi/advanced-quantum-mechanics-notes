\section*{Invertibility}

A matrix $A$ is left invertible if there exists a matrix $B$ such that $BA=\Imat$.\\

A matrix $A$ is right invertible if there exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB=\Imat$.\\

A matrix $A$ is invertible if it is both right and left invertible. Then, $B=A^{-1}$ and  $AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=\Imat$. Invertible matrices are always square. If a square matrix is left invertible, it is also right invertible, and therefore it is invertible.\\

When we have an invertible matrix $A$, any linear system $Ax=B$ has a unique solution $x=A^{-1}B$.\\

Inverse of the Product: $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$, for $A$ and $B$ invertible.
