\section*{Transformations}

A transformation $T$ is something that changes vectors in a vector space in some way:

$$\begin{matrix}
T: & V & \rightarrow & W\\
 &x & \rightarrow & T(x)
\end{matrix}$$

Here, $x\in V$ and $T(x)\in W$. $V$ is the domain and $W$ is the codomain. So, the input and output bases can be different. We could even be taking the vectors from one vector space to a completely different one. However, it may be that $V=W$.\\


A \textit{linear} transformation (linear map) is such that it verifies $T(\alpha x_1+\beta x_2)=\alpha T(x_1)+\beta T(x_2)$, $\forall \; x_1, x_2 \in V$ and $\forall \; \alpha,\;\beta \in \R$.\\

A transformation $T:  \R  \rightarrow  \R$ is just a multiplication by a scalar:

$$\begin{matrix}
T: & \R & \rightarrow & \R & &\\
 &x & \rightarrow & T(x)&=\;\;x\cdot T(1)=ax & (\text{for }$T(1)=a$)
\end{matrix}$$

The matrix $M$ of a transformation has the transforms of the vectors of the basis of the domain ($V$) written in the basis of the codomain ($W$) as its columns:

$$M=\left((v_1)_W,\;...,\;(v_n)_W\right), \text{ where } B=\{v_1,\;...,\;v_n\} \text{ is a basis of }V$$
