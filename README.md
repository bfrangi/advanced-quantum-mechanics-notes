## Introduction

Welcome to the Advanced Quantum Mechanics Notes repository! This collection of notes is the result of my 
efforts during the Fall 2023 semester in the Advanced Quantum Mechanics course at Carlos III University. 
These notes are intended to be a comprehensive resource for students studying quantum mechanics at an 
advanced level.

## Course Overview

The Advanced Quantum Mechanics course at Carlos III University is designed for Engineering Physics 
students and delves into advanced concepts and mathematical formalisms in quantum mechanics.
The course covers topics such as:

- The Mathematical Tools of Quantum Mechanics.
- The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics.
- Angular Momentum.
- Approximation Methods for Stationary States in Quantum Mechanics.
- Introduction to Light Matter Interaction and Time Dependent Perturbation Theory.
- Identical Particles and Many Electron Atoms.

The notes in this repository cover a wide range of topics discussed in the Advanced Quantum Mechanics course. Some key features of the content include:

- Detailed explanations of complex quantum mechanics concepts.
- Clear derivations of important equations and theorems.
- In-depth examples and applications to reinforce understanding.

Feel free to explore the content and use it as a supplementary resource to your course materials.
